As I used this website to get to know Rust's webassembly it is very experimental in nature. What you currently see is an actual Xterm.js terminal CLI/TUI interface which is navigated using your keyboard, as you would in a real-world TUI.

_In case you don't have a keyboard around or don't care about the fancy bits of this page click the "tey.sh" logo on the top left corner to view it in plain HTML and CSS :)_
