## svelte-konva

_open-source, Svelte, TypeScript_

**svelte-konva is the official Svelte wrapper for the Konva 2d html5 canvas library.**

Konva allows users to easily draw shapes and listen to events on html5 canvas using JavaScript. svelte-konva combines and leverages Svelte's reactivity system with the simplicity of Konva to enable users to easily create reactive html5 canvas applications in Svelte. The wrapper is well tested using vitest ensuring a continuously high software quality. Being written in Typescript, users of the wrapper also benefit from well working autocompletion and documentation of the Svelte components.

## PCA9535 embedded-hal driver

_open-source, Rust_

**A Rust embedded-hal compatible driver for the PCA9535 IO-Expander chip.**

The driver is fully compatible with the Rust [embedded-hal](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) which allows it to be used with a vast amount of different target systems. The driver is automatically tested against the real hardware using a Raspberry Pi roughly similar to HIL-Testing.
